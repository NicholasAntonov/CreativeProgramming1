BASIC BOT
Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org

With some basic Python code, we can build a generative bot
that posts directly to Twitter! In this example, we pick some
random words from three corpi (lists of text) and merge them
using a sentence template.

TWITTER DEV ACCOUNT SETUP
To get your new bot account (or your personal one) set up for
Twitter, see these instructions:

	https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/blob/
	master/Code/Week08/TwitterDevAccountSetup.md

REQUIRED LIBRARY
For this project, you'll need the Twitter library, available here:

	https://github.com/bear/python-twitter

You can install it using the Pip program in the command line, or
manually. Instructions for both methods are here:

	https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

CHALLENGES
1. Experiment with the template, or build your own!
2. Can you make several templates that get chosen at random? (Hint: use
   the random library's random.random() method to get a number between
   0â€“1 to drive an if/else conditional like we did in the Randomness
   examples.)
3. Can you double-check that your Tweet is less than 140 characters?
   (Hint: len('some string of text') will give you the number of
   chars in a string.)
