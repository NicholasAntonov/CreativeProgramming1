    colors and see how the image changes?

  ** WHY JUST THE RED VALUE?
  Science tells us that the red part of a color is the best
  indicator of brightness â€“ there are other, fancier ways of
  determine this more accurately, but for our purposes, just
  getting the red value works very well and is super fast.
