RECURSION EXPERIMENTS
====

### DUE: TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21

>"To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion." – Stephen Hawking

You've now seen the visual power of recursion, capable of building intricate structures that would be impossible to code any other way. [Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) are a great example: images that have a repeating pattern that is visible at every scale, a feature called "self similarity". This branching, infinitely expanding characteristic is not just mathematically useful, but also visually exciting.

Of course, fractals are just one lens through which to explore recursion. There are lots of possibilities we could investigate using code. Your assignment for next week is to create an exciting image using recursion. It doesn't have to be a fractal, but you should think about what kinds of visual results recursion is best-suited to create, and certainly can be inspired by the work of mathemeticians and artists who create them. The main criteria here is the visual – strive to create a striking, surprising image that is beautiful, complex, ugly, psychedelic, etc. Be bold and experiment!

Your code and approach should be unique and your own, not just minor variable- or color-tweaks to existing code, meaning you will need to do lots of trial-and-error to find interesting results. The only exception would be if you hack an example or fractal beyond any recognition, turning it into something entirely your own.

Saving versions will be super helpful! Any time you start making a major change, save a version of your project so you can go back in time, in case you break something or want to iterate in another direction. You may also want to take notes, either in comments in the code or in your sketchbook, to keep track of variable settings.

**Your sketch should be at least 800x800 pixels (larger is ok too) and exported as a png file, then everything zipped and uploaded to Canvas, just like last week.**

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* Can you apply recursive color to your image as well?  
* Playing and sketching with code, without always understanding what it is doing, is great and artistically satisfying. But, can you unpack what your code is doing and add detailed comments to explain it?  

### PROJECTS SHOWN  
* Ian Burns' 1968 book [*Xerox #1*](http://p-dpa.tumblr.com/post/107006084937/xerox-book-1-ian-burn-1968-a-blank-sheet-of), photocopying a blank sheet of paper 100 times  
* Alvin Lucier's [*I Am Sitting In A Room*](http://www.ubu.com/sound/lucier.html) – you can [read more about this piece](https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2015/01/20/collecting-alvin-luciers-i-am-sitting-in-a-room/), and how MoMA acquired it  
* The amazing meme-recursion of [*Pardon me*](https://recursivelyrecursive.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/pardon-me-come-again/) (lots more info [here](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pardon-me))  
* Plus lots of fractals, creatures, and GIFs  

### RESOURCES  
* In `Readings > Week03` you'll find a PDF of *Snowflakes*, a book from 1863 with lots of amazing drawings  
* For visual inspiration, consider looking to nature for recursive patterns like ice crystals, broccoli, coral, sea urchin shells, and slime mold  
* Some programming languages don't have any iteration (like for loops) but do everything with recursion – examples include [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29) and [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29)  
* Read more about the history of recursion in computer science from two papers (also in the `Readings` folder)  

### TURNING IN  
To turn in your project, zip your sketch's folder (with the code and png file in it). To zip a folder:

* Right-click the sketch folder...  
* On Mac, click `Compress...` to zip  
* On PC, click `Send To > Compressed...`

Rename to `LastnameFirstname_RECURSION.zip` and upload to Canvas before the start of class.

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
