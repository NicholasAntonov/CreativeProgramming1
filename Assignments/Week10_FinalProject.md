FINAL PROJECT
====

### DUE: FRIDAY, MAY 12

Your final project for the semester is to make something, anything, using at least one of the tools covered in class this semester. The choice of what you'll make and what format it's output will be (screen, interactive, printed, projected) are up to you. Whatever you decide, it should be an ambitious project that is worthy of four weeks' of work, and that pushes your artistic, creative, and technical skills.

**NOTE: our critique will be during the final exam period, scheduled for Friday, May 12 from 1â€“5pm. The location, though, is incorrectly listed: we'll meet in the Studio as usual and look at your projects.**

### PROJECT CALENDAR  
**April 18:** project proposals due, feedback session; demos on working with images and pixels  
**April 25:** demos on interaction, object-oriented programming  
**May 2:** rough project prototypes due; demos on gravity and physics simulation  
**May 12:** final projects due uploaded to Canvas, updated Wiki page with project documentation, final critique, bye!  

### FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 18  
For next week, please write a written proposal outlining the project you want to make. This should be specific, and include details of 

~~Instead of just writing up ideas in a Word document, you should [create a Wiki page](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/wiki) on the class Github repo. Click the [New Page button](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/wiki/_new), and title your page `Final Project: Your Name`. (Feel free to use just your first name, or an alias, if you'd prefer to be more anonymous.)~~

Yikes, looks like you all can't make Wiki pages yourselves. Write up your proposal in Word and email to me. I'll make Wiki pages for you manually, which you should be able to edit.

Use [the template I've made](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/wiki/Final-Project:-Jeff-Thompson), changing it to fit your project. See the template for details on what your proposal should include as well. We'll use this page later to document your project when it's finished.  

**TROUBLE COMING UP WITH IDEAS?**  
As a jumping off point, think about things you've enjoyed doing this semester, and things that you're generally obsessed with. If you love binge-watching crappy 80s TV, maybe a project that manipulates or analyzes millions of frames of video from those shows? If you are super into language, maybe a poem-generating sketch that outputs printable book PDFs.

### FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 25  
For next week, you should start working on your final project. Though you don't have any deliverables next week, rough project prototypes are due in two weeks, so getting a head-start will be a big help and will catch technical problems early. Be sure to record your process as you go! This includes screenshots, inspiration images, etc which will be used in your project documentation. These will be included in your project documentation Wiki page.

### FOR TUESDAY, MAY 2  
This week, you should be continuing to work on your projects. Next week, you should have a rough prototype of your project, in code, that you can show us. It doesn't need to all be working, but should be far enough along for us to give feedback without a ton of explanation ("show, not tell"). We'll do a quick feedback sessions, talk briefly about gravity and physics, and have some work time. Note this is our last week to talk, so bring code questions and things you need help with.

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
