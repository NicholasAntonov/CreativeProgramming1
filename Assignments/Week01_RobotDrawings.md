ROBOT DRAWINGS
====

### DUE: TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7

Using the code basics you learned today, your assignment is to **generate one drawing of a robot using only code.** Use any combination of shapes, color, stroke, transparency, etc to make your robots as detailed as possible. **Your sketch should be 800 x 800 pixels, and exported as a PNG file.**

The basic structure of your sketch will be:

    void setup() {
    	size(800,800);

    	// code to draw your robot here!

    	// save your robot, but be sure to change the filename
    	save("LastnameFirstname_ROBOT.png");
    }

*If you already have some coding experience, please try to just use the methods we learned today – adding fancy code and leveraging what you know will be encouraged later, but for now I'd like you to get used to the coordinate system and Processing's drawing functions.*

### STRETCH GOALS  
No problem drawing your robot? Try these challenges:

* Make your image resizable using `width` and `height` instead of set positions  
* Try adding shading to your robot, and/or drawing in perspective!

### TURNING IN  
To turn in your project, zip your sketch's folder (with the code and png file in it). To zip a folder:

* Right-click the sketch folder...  
* On Mac, click `Compress...` to zip  
* On PC, click `Send To > Compressed...`

Rename to `LastnameFirstname_ROBOT.zip` and upload to Canvas before the start of class. In class next week, we'll run the code and look at everyone's robots together.

### PROJECTS/ARTISTS SHOWN  

* Ivan Sutherland's [*Sketchpad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) system ([video](https://youtu.be/USyoT_Ha_bA?t=3m30s))  
* *The Incredible Machine: Applications, Computer Graphics, Look at Future Uses* from Bell Laboratories in the 1960s, including lots of examples of input and output ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r18i-uR6BD4))  
* Programming by [punchcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era)  
* John Whitney's animation [*Catalog*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbV7loKp69s), created in 1966 as a record of the many visual effects he was able to create with the computer  
* Wall drawings by artist Sol Lewitt, completed from written instructions  
* Before printers, artists like John Whitney would output their work to CRT screens and photograph them (for animations, frame-by-frame) using devices like above  

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project (and most upcoming ones) will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
