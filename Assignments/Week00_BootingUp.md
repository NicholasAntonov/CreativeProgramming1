BOOTING UP
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7  

As a way to start thinking about writing code, but without the hassle of learning syntax and finding missing semicolons, we're going to make some drawings together (and then as your homework) using instructions that define what marks we can make and where they go. This mimics a few things that happen when we run code: instructions are carried out exactly as they are written, that suprising things can result from limited instructions, and that there is a rich and interesting tradition of artists and designers working this way. 

Please Manfred Mohr's *Computer Graphics* essay and, using it and our in-class work as inspiration, create a more involved drawing using instructions you create. You will want to experiment and test what different instructions and variations will do – this is called "iterative development" and is exactly what we'll do when we start writing code! You can make your drawing collaboratively or by yourself. Think about the drawings we made in class together, and Mohr's essay – feel free to embrace or push against the idea of instructions defining a creative act like drawing.

The goal is a much more fully-developed drawing that produces surprising results and feels finished. The drawings should be on 8.5x11" paper or larger (larger == better, probably), and should include a set of printed instructions on a separate sheet. Consider also the presentation of your drawing and instructions: keep everything neat and clean, select drawing implements that make sense for your particular instructions, fonts for the instruction sheet, etc. 

We also have to "boot up" a few things before we can start coding. Please:  

* Create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com) – it's free and will let you do things like create "issues" on the class page  
* Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/download) – be sure to open it and make sure everything works ok before class next week. If you have problems, send me an email or submit an "issue" (instructions below)  

**Be sure to bring your laptop, charger, and notebook next week (and every week!)**
